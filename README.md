# Static website

## Further practice

What to say about this website? This I created what seems like a long time ago, when autumn 2020 was almost about coming. Back then, a good friend of mine offered herself to introduce me into the fertile HTML and CSS ground. That's how I became so into web design and kept on practising by myself. What's behind this static website is nothing but the most organic steps I took into this awesome field and I am able to affirm that I enjoyed from A to Z in the making. And now, a few months later, after having started formal studies at Ada ITW, I feel like I own this field as much as to embrace my first attempts to design a website and to stick together the wrecked parts of it.

I really hope this is a NJZ ("no judgement zone") because I'm really fond of this cute first idea ever I came up with when I started learning Hypertext Markup Language.
